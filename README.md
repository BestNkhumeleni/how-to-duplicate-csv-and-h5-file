# how-to-duplicate-csv-and-h5-file
a sollution to duplicating a modifying csv and h5 files


essentially i was trying to duplicate a csv file and an h5 file, but modify it so that the last entries values a copied over twice.
some of the code in here can be salvaged or used as an example of h5 and csv file format manipulation

The is a bunch of somewhat redundant code but all a demonstration of various way to use these file formats
